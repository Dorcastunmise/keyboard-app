# Getting Started
First, you need to create three files:
1. HTML File
2. CSS File. 
3. JavaScript file.
After creating these files just paste the codes in your file.

   First, create an HTML file with the name of index.html and paste the given codes in your HTML file. Remember, you have to create a file with .html extension.
Thatâ€™s all, now youâ€™ve successfully created an interactive Keyboard using only HTML, CSS & JS. If your code doesnâ€™t work or youâ€™ve faced any error/problem then please comment or contact me from the social media handles in bio. ðŸŒ±
